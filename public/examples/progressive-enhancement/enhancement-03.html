							was an American mathematician whose calculations of orbital

						</p>
						<p>
							During her 33-year career at NASA and its predecessor, she earned
							a reputation for mastering complex manual calculations and helped
							pioneer the use of computers to perform the tasks. The space
							agency noted her &ldquo;historical role as one of the first
							African-American women to work as a NASA scientist&rdquo;.

							In 1949, she became acting supervisor of the West Area Computers,
							the first African-American woman to receive a promotion and
							supervise a group of staff at the center.
						</p>
						<p>
							She later was promoted officially to the position of supervisor.
							During her 28-year career, Vaughan prepared for the introduction
							of computers in the early 1960s by teaching herself and her staff
