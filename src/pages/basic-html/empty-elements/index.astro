			<h1>Empty elements</h1>
			<p>
				Some HTML elements will never have content. Generally, these are
				elements that insert something into the page, such as an image or a form
				field.
			</p>
			<p>
				Perhaps the simplest of the empty elements is the <code>br</code> or &ldquo;break&rdquo;
				element. As an empty element, it has no closing tag. It looks like this:
				<code>&lt;br&gt;</code>
			</p>
			<p>
				The <code>br</code> element is a bad element. It is probably the most abused
				element in all of HTML. Possible exception: headings. The <code>br</code
				> element is used to add a line break. For example, when printing lines of
				poetry. This:
			</p>
			<CodeBlock snippet={poemHtml} />
			<p>Renders like this:</p>
			<blockquote>
				â€¦.the Cambridge ladies do not care, above<br />
				Cambridge if sometimes in its box of<br />
				sky lavender and cornerless,the<br />
				moon rattles like a fragment of angry candy
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				That seems reasonable. So what&rsquo;s so bad about the <code>br</code> element?
			</p>
			<p>
				Simply this: devs often abuse it for <strong>spacing.</strong> They&rsquo;ll
				use a string of <code>br</code> elements to push two bits of content apart.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Stylesheets are used for spacing; not HTML elements!</strong>
				Use the <code>br</code> element sparingly, if at all.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are a few other empty elements, but we will cover them as we need
				them: just in time.
